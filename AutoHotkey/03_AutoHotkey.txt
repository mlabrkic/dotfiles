If you want to call your scripts from PowerShell you can use:
& "C:\Program Files\AutoHotkey\AutoHotkey.exe" "C:\Temp\Start.ahk"

If you want to call your scripts from vbscript you can use:
Set oWS = CreateObject("WScript.Shell")
sPath = chr(34) & "C:\System\AHK\C:\Temp\Start.ahk" & Chr(34)
errResult = oWS.Run(sPath,,False)

A basic example of a script could be:
; make Win+n as a hotkey for launching Notepad
#n::Run Notepad

he below script would enter the signature text when you press F6:
; pressing F6 to insert your signature
F8::
Send Best,{Enter}{Enter} Bob Smith
Return

Finally, keystrokes can also be sent in response to abbreviations you type, which are known as hotstrings.
For example, whenever you type Btw followed by a space or comma, the following line will replace it with "By the way":
::btw::by the way

Getting input from the user with MsgBox, InputBox, etc.

Clipboard: The variable named Clipboard is special because it contains the current text on the Windows clipboard.
Even so, it can be used as though it were a normal variable.
For example, the following line would display the current contents of the clipboard:
MsgBox %clipboard%

To alter the clipboard, consider the following example, which replaces the current contents of the clipboard with new text:
clipboard = A line of text.`r`nA second line of text.`r`n

In the above, `r and `n (accent followed by the letter "r" or "n") are used to indicate two special characters:
carriage return and linefeed.
These two characters start a new line of text as though the user had pressed Enter.

To append text to the clipboard (or any other variable), follow this example:
clipboard = %clipboard% And here is the text to append.

See the clipboard and variables sections for more details.
